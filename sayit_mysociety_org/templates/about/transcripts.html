    <h1>How to get your transcripts online</h1>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a guide for non-technical readers &ndash;
<a href="/about/developers">read the technical introduction</a>.</p>

<p>Are you a citizen, journalist, campaigner, researcher or public servant who
has to use transcripts regularly, and who feels the whole thing could be a lot
better and easier?</p>

<p>SayIt has been built to make transcripts attractive, easy to search, easy to
share, and easy to read on devices of all sizes. And we’re very keen to hear
from people who know about transcripts that would benefit from being published
in a nice, modern way.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>How do I get my transcripts published using SayIt?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If you are willing to enter the transcripts manually and have them
        hosted on this site, then you can <a
            href="http://sayit.mysociety.org/instances/add">create a new
            instance</a>, invite people to help you, and enter speeches into
        the system.</p>

        <p>If you already have transcripts in some form of machine-readable
        format, then they need to be converted into a special format so they
        can be published online. This standard has the name Akoma Ntoso, and
        more details can be found in our
            <a href="/about/developers">technical introduction</a>.</p>

        <p>We don’t expect anyone except computer programmers to be able to
        make data in this format, but if you
        <a href="/about/community">get in touch</a> with us, we
        can work with you to see if we can find someone who might be willing to
        help you.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Where will my transcripts be published, once they&rsquo;re formatted
    correctly?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>You have two options:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We host your transcripts for you, at a mysociety.org URL</li>
            <li>You host your own version of SayIt, and publish your
            transcripts as part of your own website.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Either of these options will require technical skills, so
        again we ask that you <a href="/about/community">get in
        touch</a> to see if we can hook you up.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I produce new transcripts directly in SayIt?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Yes, you can, by <a
            href="http://sayit.mysociety.org/instances/add">creating an
            instance</a>. If you produce minutes for regular meetings, we’d
        love to talk to you about how we can make our transcript-making
        interface as good as possible.</p>
