                This is really just a placeholder for someone with design skills.
                We can't currently display the username, as it might be generated
                and ugly, and we can't currently display firstname/lastname,
                as we probably don't have them.

                I guess we could display the creator's email address if that's
                already been made known to someone invited to use an instance.
