msgid ""
"<a href=\"http://poplus.org/\">Poplus</a> is a global collaboration of "
"groups that believe it is currently too difficult and expensive to build "
"effective new digital tools to help citizens exert power over institutions. "
"Poplus Components are loosely joined tools, mostly structured as web "
"services, that can be used to radically decrease the development time of "
"empowerment sites and apps."

msgstr ""

#: templates/about/questions.html:37
msgid ""
"Transcripts are a kind of oil that greases the wheels of well-functioning "
"societies. They let people discover when powerful people have made "
"pronouncements that affect less powerful people. We believe that by making "
"transcripts function better, more people will end up learning about "
"decisions and opinions that affect their lives."

"Search within one person’s speeches, even if they only speak occasionally; "

msgid ""
"In web development, ‘Beta’ is the name for a release of a piece of software "

msgstr ""

#: templates/about/questions.html:93
msgid ""
"Online video is definitely amazing stuff. But text transcripts offer certain "
"virtues too, which makes them valuable in different ways. If you want to "
"know whether a committee has been talking about you, or you want to "
"subscribe to be sent alerts when your street gets mentioned by powerful "
"people, then written transcripts, made of nicely structured data, are hard "
"to beat. The ideal system would clearly mix written words, audio and video, "
"and being open source we hope that SayIt can be integrated with other "
"systems that specialise in AV. We&rsquo;re keen to talk to people running "
