sayit.mysociety.org
===================

This repository contains a Django project that uses the
[SayIt](https://github.com/mysociety/sayit) component to provide a hosting
service for transcripts, presenting them in a modern, searchable format.

Examples of transcripts hosted by mySociety's deployment of this hosting
project:

* [The Leveson Inquiry](http://leveson.sayit.mysociety.org/)
* [The Charles Taylor trial](http://charles-taylor.sayit.mysociety.org/)
* [The plays of Shakespeare](http://shakespeare.sayit.mysociety.org/)

SayIt is a [Poplus component](http://poplus.org/) by
[mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/). It is a Django application that can be
included in your own Django project, or run standalone. If you want to host
your own transcripts in SayIt, please see the
[Sayit repository](https://github.com/mysociety/sayit); this repository is a
remote hosting service on top of SayIt, similar to wordpress.com compared with
wordpress.org.

Installation
------------

You will need to have the following installed:

* [elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org/) (version 5 is not yet supported)

* PostgreSQL

* The compass and zurb-foundation gems. It's easiest if you install bundler,
  and run something like the following, which places binaries in the expected
  place: `bundle install --deployment --path ../gems --binstubs ../gem-bin`

* pip, virtualenv and yui-compressor.

* The development files for libffi and libssl
  (if you're installing on a Mac, you might want to look at
  https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/)

There is a list of the required Debian/Ubuntu packages in conf/packages.

Clone the repository:

    mkdir sayit.mysociety.org
    cd sayit.mysociety.org
    git clone https://github.com/mysociety/sayit.mysociety.org

Create a PostgreSQL database and user:

    sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# CREATE USER sayit WITH password 'sayit';
    CREATE ROLE
    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE sayit WITH OWNER sayit;
    CREATE DATABASE

Set up a python virtual environment, activate it, and install the required
python packages:

    virtualenv virtualenv-sayit
    source virtualenv-sayit/bin/activate
    cd sayit.mysociety.org
    pip install --requirement requirements.txt

Alter the settings to match your setup:

    cp conf/general.yml-example conf/general.yml

Set up the database:

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate

The development server should now run fine:

    ./manage.py runserver

You'll want to use http://127.0.0.1.xip.io:8000/ and instances can be seen at
e.g. http://default.127.0.0.1.xip.io:8000/

To gather all the static files together in deployment, you'll use:

    ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput

And to compile language .mo files:

    ./manage.py compilemessages
