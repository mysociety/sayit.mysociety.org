<div style="max-width: 40em"> <p>This is a collection of speeches from the
Labour party, but it all began with the Conservatives.</p>

 <p>In November 2013, a news story revealed that the Conservative party had
removed pre-election party speeches from their official website. Nor were
they indexed on sites that ordinarily store old versions of the web,
like <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>. You can see more
background in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24924185">this
BBC news story</a>.</p>

 <p>This site you’re looking at now was created by <a
href="https://mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>. As an organisation, we’re pretty
keen on political transparency. We believe that people should be able to
refer back to statements and promises made by politicians in the past - how
else can they be held to account?</p>

 <p>By happy coincidence, just as the Conservative speeches party story hit
the news, we were putting finishing touches to our newest product, <a
href="http://sayit.mysociety.org/">SayIt</a> - software that makes it really
simple to publish speeches and transcripts. This seemed like a great use for
it.</p>

 <p>So we’ve scraped cached pages of the Conservative speeches and <a
href="http://conservative-speeches.sayit.mysociety.org">republished them</a>,
in a format that’s very easy to search, browse and share. In the interests of
fairness, we’ve also sourced and republished here all the Labour speeches we
could find, although at the time of writing, these are currently still publicly
available on <a href="http://archive.labour.org.uk">Labour’s site</a>.</p>

 <p>These two sets of speeches represent everything that was previously
published on the official Conservative site (covering the years 1998 to 2010)
and that is currently on the official Labour site (covering 2010 to 2013). As
this is a one-off project designed to fill a gap in the public archive, we
have no plans to continue updating it as new speeches are made.</p>

 <p>We’ve no objection to someone else doing that, though! If you’d like to
take the project over, <a href="mailto:sayit@mysociety.org">drop us a
line</a> and we can talk.</p>
