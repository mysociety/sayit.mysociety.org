      <h1>Looking for SayIt?</h1>
      <p>SayIt was a <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> project which made it simple to to organise, publish, and share transcripts.</p>

        <p>SayIt was created to make transcripts easy to read, search and share on the modern internet.<p>

        <p>Transcripts are a kind of oil that greases the wheels of well-functioning societies. They let people discover when powerful people have made pronouncements that affect less powerful people. We believe that by making transcripts function better, more people will end up learning about decisions and opinions that affect their lives.</p>

        <p>Over the years SayIt has hosted transcripts of all kinds. Not only the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721082621/https://leveson.sayit.mysociety.org/">Leveson Inquiry</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721082725/https://charles-taylor.sayit.mysociety.org/">the trial of Charles Taylor</a> (former President of Liberia), speeches recovered from the online archives of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721082649/https://conservative-speeches.sayit.mysociety.org/">Conservative</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721082611/https://labour-speeches.sayit.mysociety.org/">Labour</a> parties, but also many user-generated transcripts too.</p>

        <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

        <p>We've had to close down sites in the past in order to focus on current priorities and sadly that time has come for SayIt.</p>

        <p>Although we believe that the concept is a good one and that having searchable, web friendly transcripts is a good thing, we don't have the resources to continue to maintain or develop it. This means that we're no longer able to continue running the service itself.</p>
